# N-Queens-MCMC

Welcome to our github repo, you will find here our work on the N-queens problem as part of our project in Markov Chain & Algorithmic Applications (MCAA) course at EPFL, 2022. 


For the first part of the project, we apply the [Metropolis-Hastings algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm) to a find solutions to the N-Queens problem for large values of N. We also investigate the impact of different schemes for the inverse temperature coefficient $\beta$ on the convergence times of the algorithm.

For the second part of the project, we use an extension of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to estimate the number of solutions to the N-Queens problem. For N greater than 27, the true number of solutions is unknown. 

Example command for compiling the C scripts : `gcc -std=c11 -o N-Queens.exe N-Queens.c -lm`

# Structure

## Part 1.

`N-Queens.c` : C script implementing Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Compile and run to produce two files, namely 
1. `N_Queens_solution.csv` : Two columns of integers from 1 to N representing row and column indices of a solution to the N-queens problem. The value of N is 1000, which is hardcoded.
2. `losses.csv` : A single row of comment separated integers representing the loss at every iteration of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.

## Part 2.

`Count-solutions.c` :
