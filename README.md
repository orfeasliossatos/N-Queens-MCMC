# N-Queens-MCMC

Welcome to our github repo, you will find here our work on the N-queens problem as part of our project in Markov Chain & Algorithmic Applications (MCAA) course at EPFL, 2022. We develop here an algorithm to find solutions to the N-Queens problem using the [Metropolis-Hastings algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolis%E2%80%93Hastings_algorithm).

# Structure

`N-Queens.ipynb` : Notebook to explain our work on N-queens problem and to present the pythonic implementation.

`N-Queens.c` : C script implementing Metropolis-Hastings algorithm.
